                Add and replace text in Pages on Mac There are a number of ways
                to add text to a document. You can replace placeholder text in a
                template; add text in a text box outside the main document body,
                such as in a sidebar; and add text inside a shape. In a
                word-processing document, you can have text in the main body of
                the document, then add text boxes for things like sidebars. In a
                page layout document, all text is contained in one or more text
                boxes.
